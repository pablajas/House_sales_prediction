# House Price Prediction Model

## Introduction
This repository is home to a machine learning project focused on predicting house sale prices. Our approach systematically works through key data science steps:

1. **Data Analysis**: Conducting comprehensive data summaries and visualization to understand the dynamics affecting house prices.
2. **Data Preparation**: Implementing feature selection, preprocessing, and transformation techniques to ready the data for modeling.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Testing various predictive algorithms, evaluating model performance, and reporting the findings.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the datasets used for training and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.

## Data Analysis
During the data analysis phase, we:

- Identify patterns, outliers, and anomalies in the data.
- Perform statistical analysis to understand the distributions and relationships of features.
- Use visualizations such as histograms, and heatmaps to illustrate the data characteristics.

## Data Preparation
Our data preparation steps include:

- Cleaning data to handle missing values and outliers.
- Selecting relevant features that contribute most to house price predictions.
- Transforming data through handling nulls, and encoding to optimize model performance.

## Model Evaluation
We evaluate models through:

- Splitting data into training and testing sets to ensure model robustness.
- Exploring various machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forests, gradient boosting, svm).
- Assessing models using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), RÂ² score.
